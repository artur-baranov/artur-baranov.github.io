I am a PhD Student at the Department of Political Science, Northwestern University. My field is Comparative Politics, with focus on Comparative Authoritarianism. My research toolkit includes quantitative and data science methods.

Prior joining Northwestern, I studied Political Science at University College Dublin (Ireland), Tor Vergata University of Rome (Italy) and Higher School of Economics (Russia). Previously, I have worked at Accounts Chamber of the Russian Federation as transparency auditor.
