I am a PhD Student at the Department of Political Science, Northwestern University. My field is Comparative Politics, with a focus on Comparative Authoritarianism. My research toolkit includes quantitative and data science methods.

Prior to joining Northwestern,  I studied Political Science at University College Dublin in Ireland, Tor Vergata University of Rome in Italy, and the Higher School of Economics in Russia. Previously, I worked at the Accounts Chamber of the Russian Federation as a transparency auditor.
