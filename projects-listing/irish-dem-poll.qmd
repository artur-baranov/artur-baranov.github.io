In this project I have developed an interactive Shiny Dashboard for the [Irish Demographic Polling Datasets](https://github.com/Irish-Dem-Polling/datasets). The Datasets collect aggregated results on vote intentions, satisfaction with the government, and popularity of party leaders.

Using R, I have developed the following functionality:

-   Dataset selection
-   Variables subset
-   Plot customization
-   Download options
