In this project, I have created an interactive Shiny Dashboard to explore and analyze [Irish Demographic Polling Datasets](https://github.com/Irish-Dem-Polling/datasets), maintained by a team of [Dr. Stefan MÃ¼ller](https://muellerstefan.net). These datasets contain aggregated information about vote intentions, satisfaction with the government, and the popularity of party leaders in Ireland. The Shiny Dashboard, built using R, offers users a seamless and user-friendly interface to perform various tasks related to dataset exploration and visualization.

Key Functionalities:

-   Dataset selection
    -   Users can choose from a list of available Irish Demographic Polling Datasets
-   Variables subset
    -   Once a dataset is selected, users can specify which variables or columns they want to analyze
    -   The dashboard provides options to subset and filter data based on specific criteria, such as date ranges or demographic groups
-   Plot customization
    -   Users can create interactive visualizations based on the selected variables
-   Download options
    -   Users can download the customized plots and filtered datasets for further analysis or reporting
    -   Supported download formats include PNG, PDF, CSV, and Excel, allowing flexibility in exporting results
